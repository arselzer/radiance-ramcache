# DeepSeek-V4.1 host experts

DeepSeek-V4.1 Flash on four RX 9070 XT cards keeps most of its routed experts out of VRAM: in a
RAM cache, or on the NVMe drive. This directory holds the CPU kernels and tools behind the engine's
host-expert path: the CPU computes every routed expert the cards do not hold, bit-exact with the
card's MXFP4 GEMV, so every reply stays byte-identical to the base engine's.

On the loop's eight held-out prompts (64 tokens, greedy, TP4) the path takes decode from 5.03 to
about 12 tok/s and the time to first token summed over the prompts from 64.0 to about 19.5 s. Every
step was measured as an A/B window; the log is `/home/as/ds41-decode-review-20261028/NIGHT-LOG.md`.

## What runs where

- `core/place/host_expert_pool.*`: one process-wide pool of CPU workers, shared by the four rank
  threads, running the kernels in `ds41_host_experts.*`.
- `core/place/stager.*` (`FileStager::hx_*`): at each routed layer's routing sync, the experts the
  RAM cache holds go to the pool; missed ones are read from the container's planes and computed
  too, then relaid into the cache in the background. The card gets aliases for them, and their rows
  are copied over the card's before the gather.
- `core/place/plane_mirror.*`: an optional second copy of the planes on another drive.
- `core/place/router_predictor.*`: the next-layer predictor (shadow statistics; read-ahead is off).

## Configuration

Everything is opt-in and off by default. The measured best configuration:

```
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_HOST_EXPERTS=40                 # pool threads (SMT siblings help)
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_HOST_EXPERTS_SILU=<silu table captured on this card>
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_HOST_EXPERTS_POLICY=all         # every RAM-cached expert on the CPU
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_HOST_EXPERTS_MISSES=16          # misses on the CPU in passes up to 16 tokens
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_HOST_EXPERTS_ASYNC_MISSES=2     # prefill misses read while card ops issue
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_NATIVE_CACHE_MAPPED_SLABS=1
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_NATIVE_CACHE_MAPPED_SOURCE=1
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_NATIVE_CACHE_DIRECT_FILL=1
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_NATIVE_CACHE_PREGROW=1               # pin the cache's slabs at startup
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_MXFP4_PACK_SSE2=1
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_PLANE_MIRROR=<dir of the checkpoint's model-*.safetensors>
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_FILE_BUFFER_UNITS=1             # VRAM file buffers to residents
RADIANCE_EXPERIMENTAL_DS41_CACHE_WARM=1                    # fill the cache from the profile

radiance ... --tp 4 --placement expert_tiered --weights-disk-tier \
  --expert-ram-cache-total-mib 98304 --host-pool-mib 1900 \
  --max-num-batched-tokens 16 --expert-profile <decode profile>
```

| Setting | Effect measured | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `..._HOST_EXPERTS=N`, `_POLICY=all` | cached experts on the CPU: 5.63 → 5.96 tok/s | `greedy` splits with the copy link (no better); `verify` computes both and compares rows |
| `..._MISSES=16` | misses on the CPU: 5.96 → 8.89 tok/s | needs the mapped RAM cache |
| `--host-pool-mib 1900`, cache 96 GiB | +9% | the pinned pool's RAM is worth more as cache; 96 GiB leaves ~8 GiB free (88 GiB: 16.5 GiB free, −6%) |
| `..._NATIVE_CACHE_PREGROW=1` | request 2 TTFT 13.7 → 5.0 s | slabs pinned at startup (+~30 s startup) |
| `..._PLANE_MIRROR` | prefill TTFT −11% | prefill passes only (`_MIRROR_MIN_ROWS`, 2); `_MIRROR_SHARE` (0.18); turns itself off if a read fails or a shard changes; `_MIRROR_FAULT=N` tests that |
| `..._FILE_BUFFER_UNITS=1` | +9.5% (176 more VRAM experts a rank) | refused unless the CPU takes every routed unit of every pass (all, MISSES=16, passes ≤ 16 tokens) |
| `..._CACHE_WARM=1` | first request 7.1 → 11.2 tok/s, TTFT 7.9 → 4.6 s | +~14 s startup; pins the slabs first |
| `..._ASYNC_MISSES=2` | TTFT −25% | decode passes keep the direct path (no gain there) |
| `..._HOST_EXPERTS_INSERT_THREADS` (4) | | background relayout+insert threads |
| `..._PREFETCH=shadow\|on`, `_PREFETCH_K` | read-ahead: top 6 −14%, top 2 ±0 | off; shadow prints precision by prediction rank |
| `..._ACCESS_TRACE=<dir>` | | per-rank access traces for `cache_sim.py` |

## Tools

- `ab_window.sh OUT`: waits for 30 s of QFN idleness, stops the QFN container, runs each arm of
  `$ARMS` as its own server with the eight held-out prompts, compares the replies with the first
  arm's, and always restarts QFN and checks it answers. Hold both research locks first. Run it from
  a snapshot (`/home/as/ds41-claude-build/work/launch_window.sh`), never edit it while it runs, and
  never launch it from a shell that hides the cards (`ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES`). An arm is
  `POLICY[-part...]`; the parts are listed in the script (threads `tN`, cache `mMIB`, misses `MR`,
  pool `pMIB`, pregrow `G`, mirror `R`/`RNN`, file buffer cap `BN`, warm `W`, async `A`/`AN`, fault
  `ZN`, predictor `PsK`/`PoK`, ...). `PROMPTS`, `AB_REQUESTS`, `AB_MAX_TOKENS`, `AB_CONCURRENCY`
  and `MAX_SEQS` change the workload.
- `ab_requests.py`: sends a receipt's requests (token ids, `chat_text` framed like the held-out
  prompts, or `messages`) and compares arms.
- `cache_sim.py`: replays an access trace against LRU, SLRU, 2Q, aged LFU and Belady.
- `ds41_mxfp4_device_check.hip`: the kernels against the card (chain check, exhaustive SwiGLU,
  GEMV timing against two libr4d builds).
- `ds41_host_experts_test.cpp`: host tests of the kernels against the scalar reference.

## Correctness

Each row the CPU computes uses the card's arithmetic: the same lane and block order, butterfly,
BF16 rounding and no fused multiply-add. `POLICY=verify` compared 31,670 rows with the card's (and
28,413 with the plane mirror's bytes) with no difference. Every A/B arm's replies are compared with
the base engine's; the final configuration also matched it on 16 chat-framed prompts, on the eight
prompts three times on one server, and on 256-token replies.
